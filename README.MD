RATIONALE:
At the end of the project, you’ll submit a rationale that provides an insight into the development process. In this document you should include a reflection on your project (300-500 words); your original sketches; and a comparison of how the final site looks and a briefly annotated list of resources that you found helpful while creating the website. We’ll be looking to see progression of your design and development process.

SUBMISSION:
Upload the code to GitHub and submit the working link to the repository on Canvas.
Save the rationale as a Markdown file in the GitHub repository or submit as a pdf on Canvas.
